- Conceptual

  - Basic differences between C++ and C.
  - Latest C++ version. C++ 17, C++ 20 is releasing.
  - Class Association, Aggregation, Composition with examples. UML diagram if possible
  - Forward declaration 
  - Storage classes in C++? 
  - Class Stack and how it is stored in memory?
  - new and delete operators . Example
  - How new and delete are different from C dynamic memory functions?
  
  - Class - class specifiers, friend
    - Types of constructors/ destructors
    - Can constructors and destructors be virtual?
    - What is static and dynamic binding?
    - What if user don't want to create copy of object?
    - Constructor delegation
    - this pointer type and usecases
    - Why use initializer list?
    
  - C++ OOPS concepts with examples:
     - Abstraction , Encapsulation and difference  between two.
     - Inheritance - types, diamond problem, virtual functions(vptr, vtable),object slicing.
     - Polymorphism - diff variations(compile time polymorphism, runtime polymorphism, operator overloading, template overloading) with examples.
   
  - Templates 
    - Function Templates
    - Class Templates
    - Template Specialization
    
  - Abstract Classes
    - pure virtual function
    
  - File Handling - ofstream , ifstream, fstream (example)
  
  - static function, variable in classes. When to use?
  
  - Exception Handling
    - Types of Exceptions
    - What if exception not handled?
    - What if exception thrown in constructor/destructor?
    - Final Class
   
   - SOLID Principles
