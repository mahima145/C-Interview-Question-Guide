Structure padding?
functors? function operator overloaded in a class to store a result,. It can reduce the need for static variables. 
class Mul {
    int val;
    public:
    Mul() {}
    Mul(int v) {
        val =v;
        }
    int operator () (int vl){
        return vl*val;
    }
};
int main() {
    Mul m (12);
    cout<<m(2)<<endl;
    cout<<m(3)<<endl;
 
    return 0;
}
