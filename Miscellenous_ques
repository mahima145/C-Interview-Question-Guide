SOLID design principle?

-- Single Responsibility Principle = A class should have only one functionality.
-- Open Closed Principle = A class should be open for code extension but closed for modification. 
-- Liskov's Substitution Principle = Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.
-- Interface Segregation Principle = A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
-- Dependency Inversion Principle = Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module,
    but they should depend on abstractions.
